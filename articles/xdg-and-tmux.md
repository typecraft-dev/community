## What are we talking about?

This post explains how to configure the tmux plugin manager, specifically when the tmux configuration is located in the `~/.config/tmux`
directory, and is managed with a dotfiles tool like [GNU Stow](https://learn.typecraft.dev/tutorial/never-lose-your-configs-again/).

If you use [tmux](https://learn.typecraft.dev/tmux-for-newbs/) then hopefully your
`tmux.conf` file is located somewhere like `$HOME/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`,
because you are using the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).

I'm told that is what all the cool kids do.

However, the [tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm?tab=readme-ov-file#readme)(TPM)
will then install plugin files in `$HOME/.config/tmux/plugins`, and suddenly your dotfiles repo is
populated with a set of files that you probably don't want to track.

There are a couple of options:

1. Modify the dotfiles manager configuration, or `.gitignore`, to ignore these additional files and avoid saving them in the repo
2. Install the plugin files somewhere else outside `~/.config`.

Fortunately TPM allows us to install our plugin files anywhere we want via the the
[`TMUX_PLUGIN_MANAGER_PATH`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm/blob/master/docs/changing_plugins_install_dir.md)
setting,
so we will take option number 2.

The XDG Base Directory Specification does suggest a potential location to install the plugin files.
To quote from the documentation

> User-specific executable files may be stored in $HOME/.local/bin

So let's configure TPM to use the `.local/bin` location to store the plugin files.

## How To

1. Create an install directory for TPM managed plugins, `mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/tmux/plugins`

1. Install TPM to the new location with `git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.local/bin/tmux/plugins/tpm`

1. Edit the tmux configuration file (`~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`)
   
   a. Add the following setting at the top:

      ```
      set-environment -g TMUX_PLUGIN_MANAGER_PATH "$HOME/.local/bin/tmux/plugins"
      ```

   b. You also need to change the syntax of the `set -g @plugin` statements. For example:

      ```
      set -g @tpm_plugins ' \
          tmux-plugins/tpm \
          christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator \
          jimeh/tmux-themepack \
      '
      ```

      (see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmux-plugins/tpm/master/docs/tpm_not_working.md on why this is needed)

   c. Finally edit the tmux `run` statement to reflect the new path (it should be the last line in `tmux.conf`)

      ```
      run "$HOME/.local/bin/tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm"
      ```

1. plugins can now be installed by running `$HOME/.local/bin/tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins`

**NOTE**:Plugins can be updated by running `$HOME/.local/bin/tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/update_plugins all`.
